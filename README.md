# Storm-Chase
Storm Chase is a fun Commodore 64 game that was written on theC64 full size computer. The project was created and built using assorted native Commodore 64 utilities. All C64 data has been exported manually into the binary folder and the code has been converted from Turbo Assembler to work with 64TASS cross assembler. 

# What is the game all about?

You play a storm chaser, a young lad who has to save his village from flooding. Right above him is a giant magic cloud. His task is to catch the rain drops which the cloud spurts out. If the giant rain drops reaches the banks. The height of the river will rise. After the river has reached its excessive height, the village gets flooded. Your storm chaser doesn't just have to catch the rain drops. There is also a chance the crafty rain will attempt to fire a lightning bolt. If this happens, you should get away from it fast before you get a shocking experience. A life is list every time the river breaks its banks, or you get struck by the lightining bolts.
