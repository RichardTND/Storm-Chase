# Storm-Chase
Storm Chase is a fun Commodore 64 game for Scene World. The game was written on theC64 full size computer. You play a young storm chaser who has to catch raindrops from a grey clound. Also avoid the droplets from reaching the bottom, otherwise the flood gates will open. The game consists of 16 levels, which makes game play slightly difficult. Especially after the storm cloud fires lightning bolts.

The code has been converted from Turbo Assembler to work with 64TASS cross assembler. 

Requirements:

- 64Tass cross assembler
- Exomizer V3.1.1 cruncher
- Vice (any version)
- DMC V2.1 (C64 optional)
